(* The 2nd member was specified as a cap, but actually we don't get a new cap from the sender,
   we simply register the new sender with the reply cap given by the caller. *)
(* The 3rd member of the KernelOracle tuple was of type SeL4_Ntfn. My guess is this was meant
   to mean a type for the notification word. But that's only in the notification case; in the
   endpoint case, this should be the badge of the endpoint capability invoked by the sender. *)

   these aren't set in the notification case. *)

                       This part's tricky, because it's asserting the functionality of a sequence
                       of nondeterministic monads (lookup_extra_caps, copy_mrs, and transfer_caps)
                       called by do_normal_transfer, when given the data read via a machine op from
                       the sender thread's message_info register in the first place.
                       So, it's not clear to me how to proceed unless:
                       (1) we can derive `mi` for sure from the data coming out of that register,
                           i.e. if that data is `d`, then `mi = data_to_message_info d, and
                       (2) we can accurately express what `mrs_transferred` and `mi'` should be
                           after the execution of the three monads called by do_normal_transfer.
                   minfo oracle = MI mrs_transferred (mi_extra_caps mi')
                                   (mi_caps_unwrapped mi') (mi_label mi) \<close>
