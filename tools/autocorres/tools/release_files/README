This is a preview release of the NICTA AutoCorres translation tool.

The tool, used in conjunction with Michael Norrish's C parser, allows
users to reason about C code using a high-level monadic representation
of the code.

The tool is described in the paper:

    "Bridging the gap: Automatic verified abstraction of C"

    David Greenaway, June Andronick, Gerwin Klein
    Proceedings of the Third International
            Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP), August 2012


INSTALLATION:
-------------

    Typing:

        isabelle build -d . AutoCorres

    in the root of this release should build everything, including the
    C parser and AutoCorres itself.

    Once built, the examples in "autocorres/examples" can be run by
    using the built "AutoCorres" Isabelle heap.


RELEASE NOTES:
--------------

    This is a preview release of the tool, so there are a many rough
    edges. Users are encouraged to get in touch with the authors if/when
    they hit upon problems.


PACKAGE CONTENTS:
-----------------

    This package contains:

    * A preview release of the AutoCorres tool, translating the output
      of the C parser into higher-level logic.

    * A beta release of Michael Norrish's C parser, used to translate
      C code into Isabelle:

        http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/software/c-parser/

    * Norbert Schirmer's Simpl language and associated VCG tool. The
      C parser translates into C into Schirmer's Simpl language:

        http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Simpl.shtml

    * Code from SML/NJ, including an implementation of binary sets
      (Binaryset.ML) and the mllex and mlyacc tools
      (tools/{mllex,mlyacc}). These are used by the C parser.

    * Code from the mlton compiler, in particular regions during lexing
      and parsing (Region.ML, SourceFile.ML and SourcePos.ML). These are
      used by the C parser.

    * NICTA compatibility word libraries and associated lemmas, for
      assisting with reasoning about words (such as 32-bit words).

    * Libraries from NICTA for defining and reasoning about monads,
      including definitions for nondeterministic state monads and option
      monads, along with a large proof library relating to these
      definitions.

    * The NICTA "wp" weakest precondition tool, which can be used to
      assists in proving Hoare triples on monadic programs.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

    * Isabelle2013-2 Interactive Theorem Prover

        http://isabelle.in.tum.de/


USAGE:
------

    Autocorres may be invoked after the C parser has completed, as follows:

        install_C_file "filename.c"
        autocorres "filename.c"

    All definitions created by both the C parser and autocorres are placed into
    a locale named "filename". (i.e., the input filename with the extension
    stripped off.)
