     Regression Specification File
     =============================

     This file contains names of tests and their associated commands
     that should be run by the regression system.

     The file also contains dependencies between tests. If test "B" is
     dependent on test "A", then regression will not attempt to run "B"
     before "A" has finished. Additionally, "B" will not be run if "A"
     fails.

     There are two main groupings in the file: "sets" and "sequences":

        * A "set" is an unordered grouping of tests. If one test in the
          set fails, the remainder will still be run. The set is
          considered to have passed if every test inside the set passed.

        * A "sequence" is an ordered grouping of tests. The tests are run
          in order. If one test fails, the remainder of the group will
          be skipped. The group is considered to have passed if every
          test inside the group passed.

     Sets and sequences may be arbitrarily nested, and a "testsuite" is
     just a "set".

     Tests may have the attributes:
        * cwd: current working directory (default: location of tests.xml)
        * timeout: real-time timeout, in seconds (default: none)
        * cpu-timeout: CPU-time timeout, in seconds (default: none)
        * depends: space-separated list of tests that must run first

     Groups of tests may also have these attributes, which are passed
     down to individual tests:
        * cwd: inner cwd's override outer ones
        * timeout, cpu-timeout: applied to each test (*not* to the group as a whole)
        * depends: adds dependencies to all tests in the group

     Note that if you specify tests to run at the command line, then
     dependencies will be calculated, but non-specified tests will not
     be run even if the specified tests depend on them.
