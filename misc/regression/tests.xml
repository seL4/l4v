     Regression Specification File
     =============================

     This file contains names of tests and their associated commands
     that should be run by the regression system.

     The file also contains dependencies between tests. If test "B" is
     dependent on test "A", then regression will not attempt to run "B"
     before "A" has finished. Additionally, "B" will not be run if "A"
     fails.

     There are two main groupings in the file: "sets" and "sequences":

        * A "set" is an unordered grouping of tests. If one test in the
          set fails, the remainder will still be run. The set is
          considered to have passed if every test inside the set passed.

        * A "sequence" is an ordered grouping of tests. The tests are run
          in order. If one test fails, the remainder of the group will
          be skipped. The group is considered to have passed if every
          test inside the group passed.

     Sets and sequences may be arbitrarily nested, and a "testsuite" is
     just a "set".

     Tags may have the attributes "cwd" (current working directory),
     "timeout" (real-time timeout in seconds) or "depends" (a
     space-separated list of tests that the current test depends on).
